# basic-encryptor-c

## Description
CLI encryptor that takes in a custom 26-character key as a command-line argument, and encrypts a user-inputted message according to their key. Written in C for a CS50x assignment.

## How to Use
Enter the terminal
Compile the code using `make substitution`
Run the file using `./substitution "KEY"` (replace "KEY" with a unique 26-letter key)
Using anything besides an alphabetic character or repeating any characters will result in an error.
